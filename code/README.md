# Code

Here you can find three directories:

+ algorithms
  + Beam_search.py : This is a best first algorithm with a maximum length of the heap (the beam).
  + Best_first.py : This is a constructive algorithm that sorts it's queue based on a heuristic value.
  + BFS.py: This is a breadth-first search algorithm
  + Branch_and_Bound: This is a depth-first search algorithm with a maximum depth that is updated when a solution is found.
  + DFS.py: This is a depth-first search algorithm.
  + Random_possible_moves: This is an algorithm that randomly chooses possible moves.

+ classes
  + archive.py: This is an archive for the constructive algorithms.
  + board.py:
  + car.py:
  + constructive_algorithm.py:
  + load_cars.py:
  + load_solution.py:
  + rushhour.py:
  + solution_txt.py:

+ visualisation
  + visualize_board.py: This class visualises a game board.
  + visualize_sequence.py: This class visualises a solution sequence.
