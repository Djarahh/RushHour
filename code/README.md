Here you can find three directories:

+ algorithms
  + beam.py : This is a best first algorithm with a maximum length of the heap (the beam).
  + best.py : This is a constructive algorithm that sorts it's queue based on a heuristic value.
  + BFS.py: This is a breadth-first search algorithm
  + branch_and_bound.py: This is a depth-first search algorithm with a maximum depth that is updated when a solution is found.
  + DFS.py: This is a depth-first search algorithm.
  + randomize.py: This is an algorithm that randomly chooses possible moves.

+ classes
