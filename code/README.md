Here you can find three directories:

+ algorithms
  + Beam_search.py : This is a best first algorithm with a maximum length of the heap (the beam).
  + Best_first.py : This is a constructive algorithm that sorts it's queue based on a heuristic value.
  + BFS.py: This is a breadth-first search algorithm
  + Branch_and_Bound: This is a depth-first search algorithm with a maximum depth that is updated when a solution is found.
  + DFS.py: This is a depth-first search algorithm.
  + Random_possible_moves: This is an algorithm that randomly chooses possible moves.
