State space:

Every car on a RushHour board has 4 or 5 options, depending on it's length.
This is how we came up with the following formula to calculate the
upper bound(UB) of the state space:

x = cars of length 2
y = cars of length 3
n = board length

UB = (n- 1)^x * (n-2)^y

Objective function:

For every car that's in the way of the little red car at least one or more moves
has to be done. This is the lower bound. 

If you add the constraint of only using a certain composition of the cars one
time, the upper bound is the same as the upper bound of the state space.
